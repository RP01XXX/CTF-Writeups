# PWN07 - Database Crack
We did it, we managed to get a copy of a password database from Johnny Ezell. Can you crack the password to get into the database and see what things lie within?

 Solution
Step 1. 
  The user must take the file and run keepass2john against it:
  CMD: keepass2john mySecret.kdbx > hash.txt  (any name file)
  This will push out a password hash that you need to use JohnTheRipper to crack.

Step 2: 
  Finding the wordlist to crack with is important, Rockyou.txt wont do it. Now if you have an older version of fastrack.txt then it will crack it. If not, you go to ghosttown
  find a wordlist in one of the chat logs. Copy and paste this  into a txt file to make your own wordlist. Here is a small snippet of the words.
          sqlsql
          password1
          password123
          complexpassword
          database
          server
          changeme
          change
          sqlserver2000
          sqlserver2005

Step 3:
  Cracking the hash requires JohnTheRipper and the new wordlist. Simply run the following command. 
  CMD: john --wordlist=<your wordlist> hash.txt
     Note: hash.txt should be the pathway to your hash file from step 1.

Step 3: 
  You have the password to log into the database its complexpassword. Log into the database, open the PWN07 entry to find the flag.

# OSINT6 - My Next Target
Description
deephax has a new target in mind. Its up to you to discover who it is and warn them before it's too late. He keeps talking about visiting sometime. Use the mySecret.kdbx database from PWN07 - Database Crack to identify the target. The historical data for the database is not related to the challenge and just an artifact.

Step 1: 
Go  to the discussion board and locate a conversation called When I am Not Hacking Im Packing. You find a talk about their favorite leisure places. You will find he mentions a drink called the Lizard Lick Drink from the Caribbean.

Step 2: 
Google "Lizard Lick Drink Caribbean" or "Lizard Lick" carribean bar you will find https://www.lazylizardbarandgrill.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lazy-Lizard-Menu-2019.pdf

Step 3:You should identify this location as Caye Caulker Belize

Step 4: If you go to Google Images and begin looking at images of this location you will find an image where the user William Jones took a picture at the bar in May 2019. This image will reveal a post where the flag is written. https://www.google.com/maps/@17.7503011,-88.0242681,3a,90y,309.12h,76.72t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipM3jk39GMOAbYhFktOGKYdEGYV3NhagaFOKZQjo!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipM3jk39GMOAbYhFktOGKYdEGYV3NhagaFOKZQjo%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya308.2949-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352

Challenge
Someone doesn't understand networking traffic. Can you finds the flag from the PCAP file?
Super simple network review, if you search through the traffic by using the filter "Telnet" you see a whole string of telnet traffic. If you right click and follow the TCP stream
you will be able to scroll through this you will find the flag.

CRYPT009 - Pandoras Box
**Challenge**
Pandora's box, we have found it! Even better, the last travelers knew the numbered code to get in but they couldn't figure out the transcription. Figure out the the transcription's translation to find the flag!

Submit the flag as: `flag{word_word_word_word}`

This is a simple Caesars shift but in a twisted way. The number tells you how far to shift the letter to the right. Simply move the letters over to the left by the numbers to solve the problem.
